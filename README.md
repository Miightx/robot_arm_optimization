### Optimization project

The purpose of the project is to determine the angular positions 洧랚1(洧노) and 洧랚2(洧노) that generate a given trajectory 洧녞[洧논(洧노),洧녽(洧노)]. This is known as an 'inverse' problem, in which the inputs of a model (here the angles 洧랚1 and 洧랚2) must be determined to obtain the desired output (here the coordinates 洧논 and 洧녽). The solutions we seek to solve our problem are therefore the roots of Rx. 

In order to find the solutions, we implemented different algorithms such as root, minimize, adaptive step gradient and the Newton's method. We also figured out the limits of the algorithms and their avantages and disavantages.
